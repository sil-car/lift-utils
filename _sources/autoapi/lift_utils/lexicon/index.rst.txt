.. py:class:: Entry(xml_tree: Optional[lxml.etree.ElementTree] = None)


   Bases: :py:obj:`lift_utils.base.Extensible`

   This is the core of a lexicon. A lexicon is made up of a set of entries.

   :ivar Optional[RefId] id: This gives a unique identifier to this ``entry``.
   :ivar Optional[str] guid: `Deprecated.` This gives a unique identifier to
       this entry in the form of a “universally unique identifier” (RFC 4122).
   :ivar Optional[int] order: This is the homograph number.
   :ivar Optional[DateTime] date_deleted: If this attribute exists then it
       indicates that the particular ``entry`` has been deleted.
   :ivar Optional[Multitext] lexical_unit: The lexical form is the primary
       lexical form as is found as the primary lexical form in the source data
       models for this standard.
   :ivar Optional[Multitext] citation: This is the form that is to be printed
       in the dictionary.
   :ivar Optional[List[Phonetic]] pronunciations: There can be multiple
       phonetic forms of an entry.
   :ivar Optional[List[Variant]] variants: Any constrained variants or free
       orthographic variants.
   :ivar Optional[List[Sense]] senses: This is where the definition goes.
   :ivar Optional[List[Note]] notes: The more notes you keep the better.
   :ivar Optional[List[Relation]] relations: Gives a lexical relationship
       between this entry and another ``entry`` or ``sense``.
   :ivar Optional[List[Etymology]] etymologies: Differs from a lexical
       relation in that it has no referent in the lexicon.
